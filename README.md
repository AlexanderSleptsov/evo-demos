# Evo Demo Apps

Demo apps for Internet of Things.

## Overview

Apps are placed into folders based on the year they were created.

Run the apps in the **Evothings Client** app, get it from Google Play or the Apple App Store. (Alternatively, you can build your own native app using Cordova and the required plugins.)
